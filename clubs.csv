Omicron Delta Kappa,"Recognizing leaders among leaders, Omicron Delta Kappa (ODK) is the most prestigious honor society at the University of Maryland. We bring together the best and brightest leaders on campus.","Omicron Delta Kappa (ODK) is a nationally recognized leadership honor society. The University of Maryland Sigma Circle acknowledges students and faculty who have contributed to the campus by highlighting leadership and bringing together all phases of collegiate life. 
The members of ODK are responsible for maintaining a high standard of efficiency in five areas of collegiate activities: scholarship; athletics; campus or community service, social and religious activities, and campus government; journalism, speech, and the mass media; and the creative and performing arts. Members should also inspire others to strive for conspicuous attainment along similar lines. 
Our mission is to be an organization of leaders among leaders that helps foster the sharing of opportunities to benefit the campus community. 
 
Omicron Delta Kappa National Leadership Honor Society was founded December 3, 1914, at Washington and Lee University, by fifteen students and faculty leaders. They felt that there was a need to recognize leadership and bring together faculty and students from the various phases of college life in the tradition of the idealism of George Washington and Robert E. Lee. They believed that through the sharing of opportunities and experience both the members of the society and the institution would benefit.
 
There were three principal founders of Omicron Delta Kappa: J. Carl Fisher, who was Business Manager of the Student Magazine; Rupert Nelson Latture, President of the YMCA; and, William Mosely Brown, Phi Beta Kappa. Together with three faculty members, including the President of the University and the Dean of Engineering, these men gradually selected nine additional men to affiliate with them. When there were fifteen members, the first public announcement of the establishment of Omicron Delta Kappa was made in the student newspaper on January 12, 1915. With the passage of Title IX of the Civil Rights Act, the first woman was elected to ODK in 1973. Prior to that, women were selected for Mortar Board and men for ODK.
 
The Sigma Circle of ODK was founded on February 2, 1927 by six men who immediately began tapping undergraduate members of ODK. Formerly, men knew that they were being considered for ODK if they were invited to the Calvert Cotillion in December. Their formal initiation would occur at a convocation in the Spring. Many famous people have been initiated into Sigma Circle, some as student and faculty members, others as Honorary members. Some of Sigma Circle’s famous members include President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Vice President Alben W. Barkley, the Earl of Halifax, Admiral Stansfield Turner, and Congressman Steny Hoyer.
 
Sigma Circle is very proud of its long and proud history. It originated the Annual Awards Banquet; awards an annual $1,000 scholarship to an incoming freshman who was a high school leader; selects the “Top Ten Freshmen” and the “Sophomore Leader of the Year;” and with the help of alumni donations constructed the ODK Fountain on McKeldin Mall, which was built to create a lasting monument to leadership and to those who have contributed so much to the campus. All of the names of those people involved with ODK since 1927 are engraved on the granite sides of the ODK Fountain, which was dedicated in April 1997.",['Honorary/Honor Society']

Maryland Model United Nations,"Maryland MUN is the primary organization at UMD dedicated to international policy and affairs. We are a nationally ranked Model UN travel team, and host our own high school conference 'UMUNC'.","MEETINGS TUESDAYS 6-7PM IN ART-SOC2203!
Founded in 2013 as UMD Model United Nations, Maryland MUN is a social-professional student organization focused on developing members' skills in public speaking, debate, leadership, networking, collaboration, and program management, as well as engaging with the world of international relations, public policy, and diplomacy.
Before 2017, UMD Model UN had sat idle for several years. In 2017, it was re-founded, but languished under poor leadership. In 2018, the organization was taken over by Sehej Singh, who, with the help of several high-profile student leaders, enacted an aggressive growth and rebranding campaign that saw the organization grow from less than 30 members to over 250 and become a top-50 nationally ranked team in less than 2 years.
Following the explosive growth of the organization, UMD MUN was poised to expand its mission beyond just that of the college Model UN circuit. In 2019, the organization ran its inaugural high school Model UN conference, UMUNC I, drawing over 150 delegates from across the country. By adding UMUNC, UMD MUN established itself as one of the premiere Model United Nations organizations in the country. The annual UMUNC conference continues to develop the next generation of diplomats and recruit high-performing high schoolers to the university.
After introducing UMUNC, UMDMUN became a powerhouse on campus and needed a restructure. The organization was now more than just a Model UN travel team, with plans to branch out further. In early 2020, UMD Model United Nations was rebranded into the Maryland International Relations Association, encompassing the UMD Model UN travel team, the UMUNC high school conference, and a brand-new section of the organization, the MIRA Institute, the professional development arm of MIRA
Through structured debate and critical thinking in general body meetings, students develop skills in public speaking, technical writing and research that will help them become future leaders in a variety of industries.
Maryland MUN is proud to be represented by a diverse group of students across campus. Despite being so topical within international relations, Maryland MUN has one of the widest ranges of majors, ages, cultures, and personal backgrounds on campus. Each member contributes something unique that has helped Maryland MUN become what it is today.","['Political', 'Professional', 'Business and Entrepreneurship']"

Disability: Identity, Culture, and Education (DICE) is a student led disability justice collective at the University of Maryland. We strive to promote disability justice by building a community and providing opportunities for advocacy to create change on campus. 
Members of this group will get together to learn about the lives and history of disabled peoples so often erased by history. These discussions will touch on topics such as disability identity, culture, and intersectionality. Our goal with education is to hold space for the voices and work of disability advocates.
Members of this group will also participate in an online and in-person community. Within this community, we hold space to acknowledge the role of ableism in society, provide resources for disabled students, and create connections with the broader disabled community. 
Finally, members will have the opportunity to promote social change through events. These events will promote disability inclusion within campus by encouraging university wide discussions of disability, strengthening faculty mindfulness, and normalizing “disability”. 
DICE strives to work with other groups on campus to promote diversity, inclusion, and intersectionality. We believe that inclusion of all people should be representative of all people, so we will constantly strive to acknowledge the different ways disability is experienced through race/ethnicity/culture, gender, class, age, and religion.
Most importantly, every member can choose how they would like to engage with the space and resources DICE provides!
If you are joining our GroupMe to promote research or a paper on disability and are looking for disabled students to answer questions on disability, please email dice.umd@gmail.com.

Our Robots:
QUBO -  Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Qubo, Somali for “turtle”, is a robotic submarine iterated on many times, swimming in the 2017 competition and again in 2022 and 2023. Each time, its modular chassis has allowed for the development of end effectors, including a torpedo launcher, claw, and marker dropper; a completely overhauled electrical interior; new sensors, including a Zed2i depth camera and Doppler Velocity Logger (DVL); and a compatible software stack that autonomously collects data and makes decisions. The team competes in the RoboSub competition every August. Qubo must autonomously navigate an underwater course filled with various tasks, such as shooting at a target, doing flips through a gate, and much more. All of this has to happen with zero communication to the robot. This competition brings a unique challenge to full autonomy, incorporating software, electrical, and mechanical engineering together to navigate a harsh environment.
TESTUDOG - Quadruped Robotic Dog 
Testudog’s name speaks for itself. This four-legged animal will walk, run, and jump all around campus through 12 quasi direct-drive motors, a fleet of sensors and a huge battery. The robot was first ideated in Fall 2022 taking a built-from-scratch approach. Everything mechanical and electrical has so far been produced solely by the team, and both custom and prebuilt software has brought it together. The dog first stood on its own at Maryland Day, Spring 2024, and the team plans on bringing it to life to one day autonomously navigate an obstacle course in IEEE’s ICRA Quadruped Challenge.
TERRAFORMERS - Mars Rover Mission Team 
The team plans to compete in the international University Rover Challenge (URC) in Utah every summer. Here, teams from all over the world work to make robust, reliable, autonomous platforms built for the harsh space environment. Utah’s deserts make for an environment adjacent to that of Mars, allowing teams to simulate their rovers operating on the planet. With the help of theory and simulation, the team must also demonstrate the ability to translate their product into something fit for a real trip to space. This competition successfully completes R@M’s takeover of land, air, space and sea, as they apply robotics in the most hazardous environment of them all - Space!

The Science Café at College Park,"Join us for Coffee, Refreshments, and a Book discussion! An environment where all students, especially STEM majors, in particular, can further broaden their scope of education through various forms of literature.","The organization's purpose is to create an environment where all students, especially STEM majors, in particular, can further broaden their scope of education through various forms of literature in order to develop students into more analytical and well-rounded thinkers.
 
The organization plans on serving as a sort of diversion from the technical classes many STEM students face and become a place where students can read literature for their pleasure, allowing for them to build familiarity with important ideas and themes communicated through literature and add to their intellectual “toolbox”. 
 
This idea of a “STEM book club” stemmed from two University of Maryland students wanting an escape from their course-load consisting of primarily STEM classes such as Physics, Organic Chemistry, and Calculus, and who felt they were missing out on other important aspects of their education. Both founders missed the days of analytical discussions from AP English classes in high school and were keen to create a similar, more casual environment for like-minded students.
 
Although this organization is primarily catered towards STEM majors, students of all majors are welcome and encouraged to join as a diverse pool of perspectives is integral to any and all productive literary discussions.",[]
Academic Achievement Programs,"The Academic Achievement Programs (AAP) coordinates, and provides leadership, development, assessment, and supervision for 7 academic programs with the mission to provide support to various students/adults traditionally from underrepresented groups.","The root of the Academic Achievement Programs (AAP) department can be traced back to 1967, when 19 University of Maryland-Upward Bound Program students were provided academic instruction along with financial and counseling services, under the Intensive Educational Development Program (IED), which was developed in 1967.
In 1990, the AAP department was established by Dr. Jerry L. Lewis as the umbrella administrative unit to administer IED and other existing and potential programs. Through the years, hundreds of low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented students have benefited from IED and AAP. IED, being one of the first programs to focus on this student population and minority students, also was part of the foundation for the development of the Nyumburu Cultural Center and Office of Minority Student Education (OMSE) in the early 1970s.
Today, AAP maintains, coordinates, and provides leadership, development, assessment, and supervision for seven academic programs (Summer Transitional Program, Student Support Services, Intensive Educational Development, Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program, the Educational Opportunity Center, and the Educational Talent Search Programs (ETS) North and Central.","['Univ.

The Maryland Mock Trial Program,Maryland Mock Trial is a co-curricular program with teams that compete in intercollegiate tournaments around the nation. Our program has won more national championships than any other school in the country. ,"Maryland Mock Trial is a nationally ranked program that competes in intercollegiate tournaments around the country. Undergraduate students from any major and in any year of their studies, including incoming freshmen, are eligible to join the Maryland Mock Trial Program. After joining the program, students are eligible to enroll in co-curricular courses offered by the Department of Government & Politics.
 
As one of the largest programs in the nation, Maryland Mock Trial strives to support students of varying skill and experience levels. Coached by law professors and practicing attorneys, many of whom are former Maryland mockers, students who join the Maryland Mock Trial Program develop skills that are useful in any profession, not just future legal careers. Students will learn to communicate with confidence, think on their feet, argue persuasively, and become compelling storytellers.
 
Each fall, our program fields 5 to 6 teams of seven to ten students who play the roles of attorneys and witnesses in a fictional court case. In the fall, most teams attend invitational tournaments hosted by colleges and universities around the nation. In the spring, teams compete in the American Mock Trial Association's (AMTA) Regional and Opening Round Championship (ORCS) tournaments to qualify for the National Championship Tournament.
 
Maryland Mock Trial has won five AMTA national championships, which is more than any other school in the country. Because our goal is to compete at the highest level and win our sixth national championship, it is important to know that being a member of the program is a substantial time commitment (one that rivals being on a UMD athletic teams). Participation requires the attendance of meetings, practices, and competitions that are held outside of the scheduled class times, including most weekends during the semester. Though the time commitment may be daunting, many students find mock trial to be the most rewarding experience they have at Maryland.
 
Don’t know anything about mock trial? Don’t worry. If you're willing to put in the work to learn the ropes, we’ll provide you all the resources you need to succeed. Every year, we have students join the program with little to no mock trial experience who become award-winning attorneys and witnesses.

The Center's interdisciplinary and collaborative scholarship and teaching have contributed to making the University a globally recognized leader in transnational research on migration. The Center also builds upon the strong connections the University maintains in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region by collaborating with institutions such as the National Museum of American History and the German Historical Society.The University's home in Prince George's county underscores the importance of migration. At present, some 40 million (nearly 13 percent of the American people) are immigrants but in Prince George's County, immigrants and their children compose a near majority of the population. On the campus of the University of Maryland, where nearly 40 percent of the student body is defined as minority, this New America is ubiquitous. These new immigrants—from Asia, Latin America, Europe, and Africa—have transformed the campus just as they have transformed American society.

Why is the DMV home to a large community of Central Americans versus Los Angeles that is majority Mexican American versus New York that has large Puerto Rican and Dominican communities? What have been some of the obstacles Latinxs have had in the United States and what have been some triumphs? Why do some Latinxs speak only English or Spanish y otros hablan espanglish (and others speak Spanglish)? Why are Latinxs represented in popular culture as maids, cholos, or cooks and rarely as business owners or professionals? These and other questions are what the USLT courses explore.
 
The minor is only 15 credits (5 courses total) and open to undergraduate students in any field.
Range of courses: Introduction to Latina/o Studies;  Central Americans and the United States: Culture, Politics, and Community;  US-Mexico Borderlands History; Afro-Latinx Diasporas; Citizens, Immigrants, Refugees; Globalization and the Diversifying US; Latinas/o on the Silver Screen.
 
The critical thinking and writing skills you'll learn in USLT will help you excel in your chosen career or endeavor. You'll be able to think deeply about complex problems and figure out the multitude of factors that serve as the context for the issues being analyzed.
 
Check out more information about the minor by looking at USLT Handout (also linked below under ""Documents""). 
 
Student Testimonies:
“As a USLT minor, I have been exposed to a vast history of Latinas/os in the U.S. that I had not known before. Today I understand the importance of knowing the history of Latinas/os in the U.S. because it is a history that has been practically erased from the history books. Latinas/os are often cast as “problems” and as a community of “recent arrivals” and their rich history in the U.S., dating back to nearly the 18th century, is never fully represented in popular culture.” -Edwin Rodriguez, 2017
 
“Pursuing the U.S. Latina/o/ Studies Minor has opened my mind up to a large part of U.S. History that I was otherwise never taught. I started the minor last fall at the beginning of my senior year, and not once in my four years have I ever felt so excited, interested, and moved about what I was learning in the minor classes (the classes were awesome, but my professors were amazing!!!!).” -Alexia Thorpe, 2017
 
“USLT has allowed me to broaden my horizons. Coming from a scientific background, it allowed me to have more understanding of culture and the social aspects of our nation. It was a great eye opener! Being a USLT minor has allowed me to understand a group that I would like to work with in the future. Because of the skills and knowledge I have learned, I will be able to provide culturally fit care.” Karen Tchuindjo, 2017","['Univ. Department', 'Academic and Pre-Professional', 'Cultural/Ethnic']"

In the end, Lamone’s inaugural “Pitch Dingman” moment culminated with Dingman promising him one million dollars on the spot, and another million if he could accomplish the center’s first-year plans. They both made good on their word. Now over 30 years later, Dingman’s generous gift has impacted the lives of thousands of entrepreneurs who have passed through the center.
Through Dingman Center Angels (DCA), the center was the first of its kind to bring regional startup companies seeking early-stage funding to the angel investing community. DCA is the largest university-run angel investor network.
The Dingman Center was the first to organize a national meeting of leading entrepreneurship centers in the U.S., thus creating the Global Consortium of Entrepreneurship Centers (GCEC), a 200+ member organization.
The Dingman Center was the first of five centers chosen to receive the NASDAQ Award for a center of excellence in entrepreneurship.
It is the only center where two of its leaders have received the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award.","['Academic and Pre-Professional', 'Professional', 'Business and Entrepreneurship', 'Science and Technology']"

An environment where all students, especially STEM majors, in particular, can further broaden their scope of education through various forms of literature.","For information and updates about all meetings, please join our  GroupMe!
 
The organization's purpose is to create an environment where all students, especially STEM majors, in particular, can further broaden their scope of education through various forms of literature in order to develop students into more analytical and well-rounded thinkers.
 
The organization plans on serving as a sort of diversion from the technical classes many STEM students face and become a place where students can read literature for their pleasure, allowing for them to build familiarity with important ideas and themes communicated through literature and add to their intellectual “toolbox”. 
 
This idea of a “STEM book club” stemmed from two University of Maryland students wanting an escape from their course-load consisting of primarily STEM classes such as Physics, Organic Chemistry, and Calculus, and who felt they were missing out on other important aspects of their education. Both founders missed the days of analytical discussions from AP English classes in high school and were keen to create a similar, more casual environment for like-minded students.
 
Although this organization is primarily catered towards STEM majors, students of all majors are welcome and encouraged to join as a diverse pool of perspectives is integral to any and all productive literary discussions.

Community Building and EducationUnderstanding the systemic inequities that lead to poor health outcomes in impoverished countries is an essential component of our work. Through curricula, webinars, discussions, and events, we raise awareness about the forces that prevent global health equity and highlight the links between poverty and poor health.
 
AdvocacyPromoting and codifying the global right to health requires targeted political action. We meet with local and national government leaders to share lessons, stories, and positive results from partner organizations and to champion legislation that eliminates barriers to care. In doing so, we advocate for the radical notion that people living in poverty deserve preferential access to high-quality health care.
 
FundraisingWe plan and host fundraising events and campaigns to ensure partners continue to have the resources to prevent senseless deaths and deliver high-quality health care in some of the world’s poorest places. Through our educational efforts and outreach with our community, we’re not only fundraising—we’re also radically reimagining how wealth and health care access are understood.

Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia is the world’s oldest and largest secret national fraternal society in music. Sinfonia was born on October 6, 1898, at the New England Conservatory in Boston, when a group of thirteen young men under the guidance of Ossian Everett Mills sought ""to consider the social life of the young men students of that institution [and] to devise ways and means by which it might be improved."" Sinfonia became a national fraternity on October 6, 1900, with the admission of a group of men at the Broad Street Conservatory in Philadelphia. For over a century, Sinfonians in nearly every field of study and professional endeavor have transformed music in America.

What is a Brain-Computer Interface?
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUFvkQ_Nrvc
 
Brain-computer interfaces (BCI's) are an exciting emerging technology that will allow us to control computers and machines and communicate with each other just using our thoughts! This interdisciplinary topic combines neuroscience, machine learning, electronics, signal processing, and programming in order to analyze and interpret brainwaves. This technology is already being used in research to allow people with lost limbs to control prosthetics via their brain's natural instructions and to allow people with hand paralysis to enter words into a computer using their thoughts. And companies like Facebook and Elon Musk's Neuralink are actively working towards integrating this technology into future consumer products.
 
So what do we do?
 
Our organization will be affiliated with NeuroTechX, “a non-profit organization whose mission is to facilitate the advancement of neurotechnology by providing key resources and learning opportunities, and by being leaders in local and worldwide technological initiatives”, as a NeuroTechX Student Club. We host weekly workshops on different topics related to neurotech and work on cool projects using non-invasive BCIs, such as a device like a headset or hat that detect brainwaves on the surface of your head so that you can make sense of it.

Student Success Leadership Council,Student Success Leadership Council - Student leaders committed to creating events that strengthen UMD's black community,"In March 2011, the University of Maryland geared up for a project to increase the retention and graduation rates of its most vulnerable population: Black men. Six years later, Tony Randall and the Student Success Initiative have built student-led programs that empower the Black student population academically, financially and professionally.
When Tony Randall first became the Senior Manager of the Student Success Initiative (SSI) in 2011, the Black female student graduation rate was at 79.1 percent, and the Black male student graduation rate was comparably at 65 percent. The 2011 campus graduation rate stood at 81.9 percent. As Tony started to pitch the initiative to students, he found that students were passionate about this message, but felt it needed to come from other student voices. Thus, by November 2011, the Student Empowerment Project was born.

Recently resettled refugees comprise one of these groups, as they lack the financial resources required for a sufficient level of care. Also, while often overlooked, adequate oral health care is specifically crucial for overall quality of life, as oral disease can lead to life-threatening infections and pain. Therefore, Smiles for Our Future is significant for not only spreading awareness of the importance of oral care, but also providing oral care products for refugees who are in need and may not otherwise be capable of obtaining such products.

The oral health education branch is led by the VP of Oral Health Education and Advocacy who is responsible for creating engaging lesson plans for the refugees that can be shared upon donation, as well as wider advocacy events which call for awareness on oral health and the refugee community. Finally, the event coordination branch is led by the VP of Event Planning who is responsible for contacting a host organization, coordinating the time and details of the main event, and working with the other two branches to tie all the efforts together.  Then, the second major part – event execution – will involve bringing together all the planning, at the end of the semester, and finally holding a donation and education event for refugees.","['Activism/Advocacy/Awareness', 'Service', 'Health and Wellness']"
